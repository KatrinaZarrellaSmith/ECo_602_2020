## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r how to insert a code chunk}

```
# Here is a demonstration of how to use R Markdown

## Making a new code chunk

The shortcut key (on Windows) is Ctrl+Alt+i

On Mac, Command+Option+i

If I press this key combo, RStudio will insert a new code chunk.

Best practice is to give the chunk a name, it will appear in the navigation pane.
Be sure to always start the name with "r".

Highlight all the chunk of code you want to comment:
shift+ctrl+c

To uncomment, highlight all the chunk of code you want to uncomment:
shift+ctrl+c

## Reading a csv file
I'm going to read some data from a csv (comma-separated value) file

```{r loading csv file}
require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv")) #class example of birds data

```

## Previewing a data frame

I can use the head() functions to print the first few lines of a data frame.
Here's an example with the birds data.

```{r head() function}

head(dat_birds)

```

## Demo plot

I can use hist() to create a histogram:

```{r simple plot}

hist(dat_birds$aspect)

```

Notice the end of the plot does not quite look right.

## How to customize a histogram

I can add a title to the histogram by using main()

Put cursor on the gunction and press F1 to get you to the help file of function.

Notice the argument breaks() to change the size of the bins to match your data.

```{r}

hist(dat_birds$aspect,
     main = "Histogram of study site aspect",
     breaks = 36)

```
