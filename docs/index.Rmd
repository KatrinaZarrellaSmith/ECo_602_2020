<!-- The following text won't be displayed in your document.  It tells R how to make nicer looking buttons for your tabbed content. -->

Use this document as a template to build your final project.

If you've already created the file index.Rmd in your docs folder, you can paste everything below the header into that document.

If you don't yet have an index.Rmd file, save this document as index.Rmd in the docs folder of your main class folder.

Edit this template to fill in your own content.


# Introduction

Type a brief introduction here.


# Functions 1: Data Structure Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Look at the source code for the final project template, you'll notice the text:

{.tabset .tabset-pills}

This creates tabbed content for all the following sections that are one-level below.

- If you include them on a primary header (one #), all of the subsequent secondary headers will in tabs.




## `c()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The following is the markdown text needed to reproduce my code example for `c()`:


The function `c()` *combines* or *concatenates* its arguments into a vector (a 1-dimensional data structure consisting of 1 or more elements).

- All of the elements must be of the same *type*.
  - I can't combine character and numeric types in the same call to `c()`

Here's two examples using numeric and character data types:

```{r}
# Create a vector of numbers:
num_vec  = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 13)

# Create a vector of characters:
char_vec = c("a", "fish", "data is cool")
```

I can show the contents of a vector by typing the name of the vector, or using the `print()` function.

```{r}
# Typing the name of the vector into the console prints the contents
num_vec

# The print() function accomplishes the same task:
print(char_vec)
```


## `data.frame()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Creating a data frame can be done with the function `data.frame()`. Assign each column a variable name 
each column can contain a vector of any variable type

How to subset a data frame:
- If I know the name of a column, I can use the $ symbol

```{r data_frame_example_1}
# build a data frame from scratch

dat_1 = data.frame(letters = c("b", "w", "B"),
           numbers_1 = c(34, 6, 123454))

# I can print the contents by typing the name of the data frame
dat_1

# Subset a column by name
dat_1$letters

```

Type your data frame example here.

## `matrix()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```

Type your matrix example here.


## `length()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```


## `nrow()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```


## `ncol()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```

## `dim()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```

# Functions 2: Numerical Data Exploration  {.tabset .tabset-pills}

## `summary()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```

## `mean()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}


```{r}

```

## `sd()` {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```{r}

```

 


# Functions 3: Graphical Data Exploration {.tabset .tabset-pills}

See the final project description for a list of the required functions.

## `plot()`

I can use `plot()` to create scatterplots.

```{r scatterplot_1, fig.asp=0.75}
# load the penguins package:
require(palmerpenguins)

# Using formula notation:
# The response variable is on the left side, followed by the tilde expression `~`, and then all the explanatory variables are on the right side.
# I can use the `pch` argument to change the symbol.
plot(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins,
     pch = 16) 

```

## `boxplot()`

## `hist()`

## `par()` and `mfrow=`

# Functions 4: Distribution Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

See the final project description for a list of the required functions.



# Functions 5: Other Functions {.tabset .tabset-pills}

See the final project description for a list of the required functions.

OLD STUFF

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r how to insert a code chunk}

```
# Here is a demonstration of how to use R Markdown

## Making a new code chunk

The shortcut key (on Windows) is Ctrl+Alt+i

On Mac, Command+Option+i

If I press this key combo, RStudio will insert a new code chunk.

Best practice is to give the chunk a name, it will appear in the navigation pane.
Be sure to always start the name with "r".

Highlight all the chunk of code you want to comment:
shift+ctrl+c

To uncomment, highlight all the chunk of code you want to uncomment:
shift+ctrl+c

## Reading a csv file
I'm going to read some data from a csv (comma-separated value) file

```{r loading csv file}
require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv")) #class example of birds data

```

## Previewing a data frame

I can use the head() functions to print the first few lines of a data frame.
Here's an example with the birds data.

```{r head() function}

head(dat_birds)

```

## Demo plot

I can use hist() to create a histogram:

```{r simple plot}

hist(dat_birds$aspect)

```

Notice the end of the plot does not quite look right.

## How to customize a histogram

I can add a title to the histogram by using main()

Put cursor on the gunction and press F1 to get you to the help file of function.

Notice the argument breaks() to change the size of the bins to match your data.

```{r}

hist(dat_birds$aspect,
     main = "Histogram of study site aspect",
     breaks = 36)

```
